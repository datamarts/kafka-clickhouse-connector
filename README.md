## Local deployment

### The cloning and building of kafka-clickhouse-connector
```shell script
#clone
git clone https://github.com/datamarts/kafka-clickhouse-connector ~/
# build without any tests 
cd ~/kafka-clickhouse-connector
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
```

### Connectors configuration
The connector configuration files `application.yml` are located in the respective folders
`kafka-clickhouse-writer/src/main/resources/` and `kafka-clickhouse-reader/src/main/resources/`.

To run connectors correctly one has to adjust respective configuration files for `kafka-clickhouse-writer` and `kafka-clickhouse-reader` to match the key values with the Prostore configuration, namely:
-    `env: name ~ env: name`,
-    `datasource: clickhouse: database ~ adqm: datasource: database`,
-    `datasource: clickhouse: user     ~ adqm: datasource: user`,
-    `datasource: clickhouse: password ~ adqm: datasource: password`,
-    `datasource: clickhouse: hosts    ~ adqm: datasource: hosts`.

The connector services look for the configuration in the same subfolders (target) where `kafka-clickhouse-writer-<version>.jar` and `kafka-clickhouse-reader-<version>.jar` are executed.
So we create the respective symbolic links
```shell script
sudo ln -s ~/kafka-clickhouse-connector/kafka-clickhouse-writer/src/main/resources/application.yml ~/kafka-clickhouse-connector/kafka-clickhouse-writer/target/application.yml
sudo ln -s ~/kafka-clickhouse-connector/kafka-clickhouse-reader/src/main/resources/application.yml ~/kafka-clickhouse-connector/kafka-clickhouse-reader/target/application.yml
```
